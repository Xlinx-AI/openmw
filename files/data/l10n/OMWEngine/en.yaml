CellOptimizationTooltip: |-
    Default: off
    Merge static geometry within cells to reduce draw calls.
    This can improve frame rate but uses more memory.
    Changes take effect when loading a new cell.
    The optimization is performed in the background.
ChangeRequiresRestart: "This change requires a restart to take effect."
ClassicFalloff: "Classic Falloff"
ClassicFalloffTooltip: |-
    Default: off
    Use the traditional point light attenuation formula which lacks an early fade out.

    A flaw of the traditional formula is that light influence never quite reaches zero.
    This is physically accurate, but can cause lighting seams because lights do not affect the entire scene.
    Early fade out helps diminish these seams at the cost of darkening the scene.

    Morrowind uses the traditional formula, so you may want to enable this if you dislike the brightness differences.
    Alternatively, try changing the minimum interior brightness.

ForcePerPixelLighting: "Per-Pixel Lighting"
ForcePerPixelLightingTooltip: |-
    Force the use of per-pixel lighting. By default, only bump- and normal-mapped objects use per-pixel lighting.

    Only affects objects drawn with shaders.

    Enabling per-pixel lighting results in visual differences to the original MW engine as certain lights in Morrowind rely on vertex lighting to look as intended.

    Note that groundcover shaders and particle effects ignore this setting.

LightsFadeStartMultiplier: "Fade Start Multiplier"
LightsFadeStartMultiplierTooltip: "Default: 0.85\nFraction of maximum distance at which lights will start to fade.\n\nSet this to a low value for slower transitions or a high value for quicker transitions."
LightsLightingMethodTooltip: "Set the internal handling of light sources.\n\n
    \"Legacy\" always uses 8 lights per object. It provides results most similar to Morrowind's lighting.\n\n
    \"Shaders (compatibility)\" removes the 8 light limit. This mode also enables lighting on groundcover. It is recommended to use this with older hardware and a light limit closer to 8.\n\n
    \"Shaders\" carries all of the benefits that \"Shaders (compatibility)\" does, but uses a modern approach that allows for a higher max lights count with little to no performance penalties on modern hardware."

MatchSunlightToSunTooltip: |-
    In Morrowind, the apparent sun position does not match its light direction due to mysterious reasons.
    We preserve this unrealistic behavior for compatibility.
